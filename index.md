This is my personal website, where I share my work, experiences, and skills.

## About Me

I am a tech enthusiast pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. With a strong background in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C, I am passionate about the endless possibilities that technology has to offer.

My keen interest in the field of Machine Learning has allowed me to develop a solid understanding of its concepts and applications, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.

I was part of a winning team at the Hardwar hackathon conducted by UPES university, where we built an integrated building health monitoring system. Our invention received a patent, and it was a remarkable achievement for our team.

I am now open to exploring internship opportunities and networking with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and AI. With my skills and expertise in programming languages and machine learning, I believe that I can make a valuable contribution to any team in the field.
